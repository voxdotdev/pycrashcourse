### Variable Rules and Guidelines

* Variable names can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores.
* They can start with a letter or an underscore, but not with a number. 
* Spaces are not allowed in variable names, but underscores can be used to separate words in variable names.
* Avoid using Python keywords and function names as variable names 
  - keywords will error, function names will override that functions behavior
* Variable names should be short but descriptive. Name is better than n, student_name is better than s_n, name_length is better than length_of_persons_name.
* Be careful when using lowercase letter l and the uppercase letter O because they could be confused with the numbers 1 and 0.
* Generally, variables should be lowercase, as uppercase letters in variable names have special meanings.
