**The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters**

**Beautiful is better than ugly.**</br>
Python programmers embrace the notion that code can be beautiful and elegant.

Explicit is better than implicit.

**Simple is better than complex.**</br>
If there is a choice between a simple and a complex solution, use the simple solution.

**Complex is better than complicated.**</br>
Sometimes the only resolution is complex. Keep it as simple as possible.

**Flat is better than nested.**

**Sparse is better than dense.**

**Readability counts.**</br>
Even when code is complex, ensuring readability should be a high priority goal.

**Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.**

**Although practicality beats purity.**

**Errors should never pass silently.**

**Unless explicitly silenced.**

**In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.**

**There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.**</br>
If two Python programmers are asked to solve the same problem, they should come up with 
fairly compatible solutions. Granted there is room for creativity, but much of programming consists
of small common approaches to simple situations within a larger, more creative project. The basics 
should make sense to other Python programmers.

**Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.**

**Now is better than never.**</br>
Don't try to write perfect code; write code that works, and the decide whether to improve the code for that project, or move on to something new using what you learned previously to improve the next project.

**Although never is often better than *right* now.**

**If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.**

**If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.**

**Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!**
