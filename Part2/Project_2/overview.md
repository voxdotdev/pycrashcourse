# Project 2 - Data Visualization

The Data Visualization project starts in Chapter 15, in which you'll learn to
generate data and create a series of functional and beautiful visualizations
of that data using Matplotlib and Plotly.

Chapter 16 teachers you to access data from online sources and feed it into a visualization
package to create plots of weather data and a map of global earthquake activity. 

Finally, Chapter 17 shows you how to write a program to automatically download and visualize
data. Learning to make visualizations allows you to explore the field of data mining.
