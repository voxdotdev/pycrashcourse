# Generating Data

Data visualization involves exploring data through visual representations.
It's closely associated with data analysis, which uses code to explore the
patterns and connections in a data set. 

A data set can be made up of a small list of numbers that fits in one line of code
or it can be many gigabytes of data.

We'll use Matplotlib to make simple plots, such as line graphs and scatter plots.
Then we'll create a more interesting data set based on the concept of a random walk-
a visualization generated from a series of random decisions.

We'll also use a package called Plotly, which creates visualizations that work well 
on digital devices. Plotly generates visualizations that automatically resize to fit 
a variety of display devices. 

These visualizations can also include a number of interactive features, such as 
emphasizing particular aspects of the data set when users hove over different parts of the
visualization. We'll use Plotly to analyze the results of rolling dice.
