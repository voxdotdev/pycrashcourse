# Project 1 - Alien Invasion

In the Alien Invasion Project (Chapters 12, 13, 14), you'll use the Pygame
package to develop a 2D game in which the aim is to shoot down a fleet of aliens
as they drop down the screen in levels that increase in speed and difficulty.

At the end of the project, you'll have learned skills that will enable you to develop
your own 2D games in Pygame.
