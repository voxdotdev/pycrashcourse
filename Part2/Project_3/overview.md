# Project 3 - Web Applications

In the Web Applications project (Chapters 18, 19, 20), you'll use the Django
package to create a simple web application that allows users to keep a journal
about any number of topics they've been learning about. 

Users will create an account with a username and password, enter a topic, and then
make entries about what they're learning. You'll also learn how to deploy your app
so anyone in the world can access it. 

After completing this project, you'll be able to start building your own simple web
applications, and you'll be ready to delve into more thorough resources on building
applications with Django.
