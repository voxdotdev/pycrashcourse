Equivalent Function Calls

Because all positional arguments, keyword arguments, and default values can all be used together,
often you'll have several equivalent ways to call a function. Consider the following definition for 
describe_pet() with one default value provided:

'''

# def describe_pet(pet_name, animal_type='dog'):

'''
With this definition, an argument always needs to be provided for pet_name, and this 
value can be provided using the positional or keyword format. If the animal being described is not a dog, 
an argument for animal_type must be included in the call, and this argument can also be specified using 
the positional or keyword format.
