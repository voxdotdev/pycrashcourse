'''
Introducing while loops 

The for loop takes a collection of items and executes a block of code once for each item in the collection. 
In contrast, the while loop runs as long as, or WHILE, a certain condition is true. 

'''

current_number = 1

while current_number <= 5:
    print(current_number)
    current_number +=1


'''
Common use case: 
A game needs a while loop to keep running as long ass you want to keep playing, 
and so it can stop running as soon as you ask it to quit.
