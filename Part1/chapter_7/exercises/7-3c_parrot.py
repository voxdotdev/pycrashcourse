'''
Letting the User choose When to Quit

We can make the parrot program run as long as the user wants by putting most of the program inside a while loop.

We'll define a quit value and then keep the program running as long as the user has not entered the quit value.

prompt = "\nTell me something, and I will repeat it back to you:"
prompt += "\nEnter 'quit' to end the program. "


message = ""
while message != 'quit':
    message = input(prompt)

    if message != 'quit':
        print(message)
