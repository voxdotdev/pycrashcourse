Storing Data

Often times you'll want to store information users provide in data structures
such as lists and dictionaries.

When users close a program, you'll almost always want to save the information 
they entered. A simple way to do this involves storing your data using the json
module.

The json module allows you to dump simple Python data structures into a file 
and load the data from that file the next time the program runs. 
You can also use json to share data between Python programs. Even better, the
JSON data format is not specific to Python, so you can share data you store in
the JSON format with people who work in many other programming languages.

NOTE
The JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format was originally developed for JavaScript.
However, it has since become a common format used by many languages, including Python.
