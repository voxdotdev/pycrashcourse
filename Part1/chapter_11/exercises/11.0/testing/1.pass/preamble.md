## Unit Tests and Test Cases

The module *unittest* from the Python standard library provides tools for
testing your code. 

A **unit test** verifies that one specific aspect of a function's behavior is correct.

A **test case** is a collection of unit tests that together prove that a function
behaves as it's supposed to, within the full range of situations you expect it
to handle. 

A good test case considers all the possible kinds of input a function could receive
and includes tests to represent each of these situations. 

A test case with **FULL COVERAGE** includes a full range of unit tests covering all the
possible ways you can use a function.

It's often good enough to write tests for your code's critical behaviors and then
aim for full coverage only if the project starts to see widespread use.
