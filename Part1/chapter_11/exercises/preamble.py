"""
Testing your code 

In this chapter you'll learn to test your code using tools in Python's
unittest module. 

You'll learn to build a test case and check that a set of inputs results
in the output you want. 

You'll see what a passing test looks like and what a filing test looks like,
and you'll learn how a failing test can help you improve your code. 

You'll learn to test functions and classes, and you'll start to understand
how many tests to write for a project.
