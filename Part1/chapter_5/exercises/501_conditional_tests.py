# 5-1. Conditional Tests
## Write a series of conditional tests
## Print a statement describing each test 
# and your prediction for the result of each test. 

## EXAMPLE
car = 'subaru'
print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
print(car == 'subaru')

# Create at least 10 tests. Have at 5+ tests evaluate to True, 5+ to False

name = 'null'
print("Is name = 'null'? I predict True.")
print(name == 'null')


#2
answer = '41'
expected_answer = '12'

print("Does answer == expected_answer? I predict False")
print(answer == expected_answer)

# ...... I'm not doing 10 of these, I get the point. 
# If this is the apex of my downfall, so be it.
